# insta-insights
- Insta Insights is a tool designed to help manage Instagram accounts more effectively by providing information beyond what is available on the profile dashboard, particularly for individuals and businesses who rely on Instagram for networking and booking clients.

# Purpose
- As a fashion model, managing connections and career opportunities through Instagram is crucial. After networking events or fashion shows, my follower count can quickly increase with accounts that may not genuinely engage or offer opportunities. To maintain a clean and valuable feed, I need a tool to track insights into my followers and following, allowing me to remove inactive or irrelevant accounts. Insta Insights addresses this need by providing a solution to manage and optimize my Instagram presence, making it easier to focus on potential clients.
